## About
Quotify helps you turn your words into inspiration by using Machine Learning to generate quotes. Simply enter a starting phrase and quotify will complete it to give you a compelling and inspiring quote.

The model was trained by finetuning GPT2 (a state-of-the-art language model) on a [quotes dataset](https://github.com/Quotify-Bot/model-training/releases/tag/dataset). A list of quotes which were inspiring or motivating were compiled and used from this dataset. By doing so, GPT2's ability to generate English text was tuned to generate quotes (transfer learning). 

The code for the model training can be found [here](https://github.com/Quotify-Bot/model-training). 

The model was deployed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). The code for deployment can be found [here](https://github.com/Quotify-Bot/quotify-backend).


## Inspiring Quotes
Some of the inspiring quotes that were generated by the model:
> #### **"Friendship is like a flower. when it blooms, it beautifies this world with its fragrance."**
</br>

> #### **"Life is like travelling through time so stop being afraid of taking a chance and start appreciating where you are in life."**
</br>

> #### **"Motivation will drive you to action, which in turn attracts inspiration from beyond."**
</br>

> #### **"In the end, it is necessary to discover your inner beauty and truth."**
</br>

> #### **"Your beauty and kindness can melt any hardness on the face of a savage world"**
